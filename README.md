# Professor-Marvin

Our code to create the baseline model is found in src directory. The methods we used for knowledge distillation and quantization, respectively, can be found in Knowledge_Distillation_Stat_Notebook.ipnyb and SimpleCompress.ipnyb.

A link to the demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C3HJ5DTgTw&ab_channel=armandave).

We hope to continue pushing updates and perhaps get integration with Mycroft home assistant in the future!
